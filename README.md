# Circuit-Simulator
Simulate a circuit of resistors in series. The resistors in the circuit will be stored in memory with the use of a linked list, with one list node per resistor. Each resistor entry will contain the following information: 1. Value of the resistance in Ohms (â„¦) 2. Label of the resistor
